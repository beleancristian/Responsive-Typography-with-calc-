    Embracing fluid typography might be easier than you think. It has wide browser support, is simple to implement and can be achieved without losing control over many important aspects of design. Unlike responsive typography, which changes only at set breakpoints, fluid typography resizes smoothly to match any device width. It is an intuitive option for a web in which we have a practically infinite number of screen sizes to support. Yet, for some reason, it is still used far less than responsive techniques.
    This might be because typography is so deeply rooted in the centuries-old history of typesetting. The concept of having “fluid” anything is often at odds with this tradition. In print, dimensions have always been fixed, but they don’t need to be on the web. That’s why I think fluid typography is a perfect match for the web. It’s a different approach for a completely different medium.</p>
    
    <p>This doesn’t mean we need to throw out all conventions and everything we know about typography. We just need to learn how to apply the techniques we know in a slightly different way. Careful attention to detail will ensure we still have a perfectly crafted experience at all screen sizes.</p>

    <p>Viewport units are what make fluid typography on the web possible. Viewport units refer to a percentage of the browser’s viewport dimensions. For example, 1 viewport width (vw) is equal to 1% of the viewport’s width. The units differ from percentages because they are always relative to the viewport, whereas a percentage is relative to the element’s parent container.</p>
    
    <p>This means that, unlike all other unit types, viewport units are not in any way related to the base font size. This difference is significant and makes the units interesting and unique.</p>
